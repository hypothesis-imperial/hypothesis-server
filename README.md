# Hypothesis Server

An addon for the [Hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis) testing library that enables continuous fuzzing tests on a dedicated server.

## Getting Started

Install the package

```
pip install hypothesisfuzzer
```

Then, create a server:

```python
from hypothesisfuzzer import FuzzServer

app = FuzzServer(config_path='config.yml')
app.run()
```

This will automatically start running a server which will read from the supplied config path.

The server does 3 things:
  - When it received a GitHub webhook HTTP request to its `/webhook` route, it will (provided the configuration has been set up correctly, it will start running indefinite Hypothesis tests.
  -
